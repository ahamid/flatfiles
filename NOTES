DSL impls cannot generate records from FactoryGirl-generated instances, as FactoryGirl does not fill the internal pascal string length fields (this differs from previous impl which relied on record to generate its own values internally)

DSL impl can probably continue to be refactored to be simpler, it can be a source of confusion, especially WRT metaprogramming and class factories.

File/String IO resource abstraction is obnoxious...shouldn't there be a better way to abstract this

limiting doesn't yet work with record fetching (through Veritas) as this requires a sort on all Veritas relation fields

sythetic :index field is added via struct impls, not as an ignored DSL attribute
